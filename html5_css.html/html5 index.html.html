            <h3>Main Arc</h3>
            <p3>The Chunin Exams: The Chunin Exams are a significant event in the Naruto universe. They are a series of
                tests designed to evaluate and promote genin (junior ninjas) to the rank of chunin (mid-level ninjas).
                These exams are held periodically and involve participants from various ninja villages,
                fostering both competition and cooperation among them. The exams typically consist of multiple stages,
                including written tests, survival challenges, and one-on-one combat matches. Each stage is designed to
                test different skills such as intelligence, teamwork, survival instincts, and combat abilities. The
                final stage, often the most anticipated, is a tournament where genin showcase their abilities in front
                of an audience, including high-ranking ninjas and village leaders.Success in the Chunin Exams doesn’t
                necessarily depend on winning matches but rather on demonstrating
                the qualities of a chunin, such as leadership, strategy, and resilience. This means that even those
                who don’t win their matches can still be promoted if they impress the examiners.</p3>
